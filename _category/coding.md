```python
print("Hello world!")
```

My primary coding language is Python, and I would describe myself as a Python user since 2016. I have learnt some Matlab and (very briefly) played around with R, C and C++ in my school days. Right now, I am learning some Ruby and [Liquid][liquid] template language, hoping there is just enough knowledge for me to customize this website as I like.

My motto in coding is to "fake it until you make it" -- definitely not asking you to hide your bugs! Instead, any programmer with any level of experience tend to feel that they are not competent in coding. Don't panic when you encounter a bug or cannot work out the `O(n)` solution: it takes a lot of practice to polish coding skills, and the best way to improve is to code a lot, engage and learn from other experienced coders, and exchange ideas. 

Talking about coding languages, it is arguable whether LaTeX counts as one, but I personally really like to typeset with it. As a Linux user, I sometimes still prefer to write documents or make presentation sides using [LyX][lyx] and [Overleaf][overleaf]. Will they still be my top choice in the upcoming five years? Ten years? Time will tell.

All in all, that is where I am up to in this everchanging coding world. Feel free to jump into any of my posts below, as I can't wait to share what I have read and learnt with you! ;)
